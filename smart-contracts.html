            <h1>Smart Contract Systems in AgriConnect</h1>
            <p>AgriConnect uses **smart contracts** to automate and enforce agreements between farmers, consumers, and other stakeholders. This ensures that all transactions are **secure**, **transparent**, and **self-executing**, eliminating the need for intermediaries.</p>

            <!-- How Smart Contracts Work -->
            <div class="contract-info">
                <h2>How Smart Contracts Work in AgriConnect</h2>
                <p>Smart contracts are **self-executing** agreements where the terms are written directly into lines of code. When the conditions of the contract are met, the contract is automatically executed, ensuring that all parties fulfill their obligations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automated Agreements:</strong> Once agreed upon by both parties (e.g., farmer and consumer), the contract is executed automatically when conditions are met.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eliminates Intermediaries:</strong> No third-party is needed to verify transactions or settle disputes, making the process quicker and more cost-effective.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent and Secure:</strong> The contract is recorded on the **blockchain**, ensuring that all terms and transactions are transparent and tamper-proof.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Use Case Example -->
            <div class="contract-use-case">
                <h2>Example Use Case: Farmers and Consumers</h2>
                <p>When a farmer agrees to sell a specific quantity of produce to a consumer, the smart contract automatically handles the transaction once the produce is delivered and verified. The contract ensures that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The consumer pays only when the goods are received and verified for quality.</li>
                    <li>The farmer receives payment as soon as the conditions are met, with no delays.</li>
                    <li>The price and quantity are automatically recorded on the blockchain, ensuring **transparency**.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This system not only reduces the need for intermediaries but also ensures **trust** and **accountability** between both parties.</p>
            </div>
